What is Time Series Forecasting?

Making scientific projections based on data with historical time stamps is known as time series forecasting. It entails creating models through historical study, using them to draw conclusions and guide strategic decision-making in the future. 

The fact that the future result is wholly unknown at the time of the task and can only be anticipated through thorough analysis and evidence-based priors is an essential distinction in forecasting.

Numpy: 

NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra and matrices. It is an open-source project, and you can use it freely. NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

Pandas:

Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

Train test split

Our data is separated into train and test sets using the train test split() technique. We must first separate our data into features (X) and labels (y). Divided into X train, X test, Y train, and Y test, the dataframe is. The model is trained and fitted using the X train and y train sets.
